Summary:
ThreadTwin is a Gen Z-friendly web platform that helps users find high-quality fashion dupes based on fabric composition, construction, fit, and care instructions — not just visuals or price.

2. Core Feature – Fabric Similarity Score (%)

What It Does:
Each dupe result shows a % match to the original item based on:
	•	Fabric composition
	•	Construction type (ribbed, double-lined, etc.)
	•	Fit/silhouette
	•	Care instructions

How It Works (Logic):
Weighted System:
	•	Fabric Composition – 40%
	•	Construction Type – 25%
	•	Fit/Silhouette – 25%
	•	Care Instructions – 10%

Matching Algorithms:
	•	Cosine similarity or ratio comparison for fabric blend
	•	NLP or Vision API for construction and fit extraction
	•	Keyword tagging from scraped product descriptions
	•	Weighted sum = % match

Frontend Display (for each dupe card):
Color-coded % match badge:
	•	95–100%: “Exact match”
	•	80–94%: “Very similar”
	•	60–79%: “Good dupe”
	•	Below 60%: “Inspired by”

Tooltip or hover breakdown:
	•	Fabric: 95%
	•	Fit: 100%
	•	Care: 80%
	•	Construction: 100%
